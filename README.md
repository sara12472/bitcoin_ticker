Bitcoin Tracker App is a Flutter-based mobile application that displays real-time cryptocurrency prices for Bitcoin in various fiat currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP). It fetches live data from a public crypto API and allows users to select different currencies through a dropdown (Android) or a picker (iOS), updating the displayed rate dynamically.
